Welcome to my blog. I should probably make or more catchy name some point, but Lotus's Life should be just fine for now. Mainly, this was created because I felt like my life was boring; "all these people on media are, like, the same age as me and they already have so many applicable skills and cool stuff*" But I came to the revelation that I could be interesting, if I didn't spend half my on YouTube, Twitter and Reddit. This blog is a coping mechanism for that.
